Today I started this project and watched the example project video. Some of the exercises are the same that I have done before, so I will just link them. The new thing for me is Angular and I'm excited to learn it.

I'm continuing to learn Angular and making exercises. I coded through the Tour of Heroes tutorial and made Git repository for it: https://github.com/Annikkiq/angular-exercise.

I made more Angular exercises and updated the module4.

Today I'm starting this project. I installed all the necessary dependencies and I'm going through the videos.

I went through more tutorials and finished the back-end of the project. I updated some of the old code represented in the tutorial. I also have Postman already installed on my computer, so I used that to test the HTTP calls.

It took me some time to install the right Angular version since I was getting weird errors, but now I think my project is working fine. I had previously created an Angular project inside my home folder so it was conflicting with this project. Anyways now I'm back to watch the videos and ill start the front-end.
